# Responsive Web Design Training (lab04a)

This lab is a refactoring of lab-01 where I built a page with boxes whose content was rendered with a unique color in desktop view and mobile view using floats. I'll be doing the same thing but this time I'll use Flexbox or Grids for styling.

## Implementation:

- Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
- Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
- Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
